Use `python -m venv ./.venv` to create a virtual python environment.
Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (Windows).
After that install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You can turn the python file into an executable with the command `auto-py-to-exe`.
